				I am a keen, young professional, who aims to develop his expertise in the field of Software Testing. My experiences, both academic and non-academic, have helped initiate a desire to seek out my passions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Through my studies, I acquired a better understanding of the skills I would require to begin a career in the IT industry. On many instances, such as, by taking the initiative to act as the Project Manager of my second year Software Engineering group project on a SQL based Holiday Recommendation System, I have been able to turn those skills into assets.
			</p>
			<p>
				Moreover, my non-academic activities allowed me to further build on my interpersonal skills, and thus become the independent individual that I am. Through the numerous organisations that I have worked with through volunteering, I have had exposure to working with various people from all walks of life.
